I have been using NATPAT for several years without any issues, but the MagicPatch Itch Relief Patches I received seem to be the old version and the packaging is different than what is advertised on the website. I have attached a photo of the packaging I received for all 8 packs of the MagicPatch Itch Relief Patches that I received in my order versus the one on the website. The ones I received state that there are 27 patches, while the website states there are 32 patches in each pack. The shape of the patches are different as well- I recall the ones I have are the style that was originally offered years ago.   The most glaring issue is the performance and staying power of the patches I received. They fall off almost immediately and are guaranteed gone after sleeping. In the past, the patches would stay on for several days even with swimming, showering, and regular daily activities.  Overall, I'm displeased with the patches I received and I would like to get them replaced with the new version that are advertised on the website.  Thank you, Jan Heyrana --  Jan Q.

I totally understand wanting a simple, cost-effective way to keep the flea patch on your Kelpie’s collar.While we do recommend using the Pet Locket for the best fit and security, you can definitely stick the patch directly onto your dog’s collar, harness, or any other accessory that can hold it. Just make sure it’s a spot where the patch can stay put without getting chewed off easily.Agent xx"

However, the USPS we use for free shipping orders is not best and the tracking may not be reliable at times. That said, I can assure you that your order was dispatched from our warehouse in Galena, IL on July 21st and is currently on its way.Some customers have reported delivery times ranging from 9 to 15 days.
